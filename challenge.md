## Instructions

Using your favorite web editor like codepen.io or jsfiddle.net, please write code to achieve the following goals:

- Using the data linked below, create a responsive webpage similar to the example image below. (the text data in the image is for example only)

- Use a `GET` request to retrieve the data.

- Display "Full Name" and "Total Score" for the top 10 vehicles whose "Cool Factor" is at least 7, ordered by "Total Score". “Full Name” is a string constructed from "Year", "Make" and "Model".  (see example image)

- Support all modern browsers. (you can ignore IE11)

- Support all viewports. (iPhone 5 portrait through large desktop monitors)
